# Code for https://doyouneed.tech/
  
I love that people buy a whole domain just to put up a one-word joke.

This site is a little more flexible and a lot more comprehensive, but just as succinct. It has answers for every tech you can think of.

Here's an incomplete list of similar sites I've seen. Submit a pull request or email me if you want to add more.

In June 2023 this domain registration will expire. Like so many of the sites above, the joke will be short-lived. I got the domain cheap. It was either $.99 or free, I can't remember. Renewal is $50/year and definitely not worth it. I've never bothered setting up analytics or even looking at web server logs to measure traffic. I doubt anyone will care when this site goes away, but if you miss it, feel free to take the code and/or the domain!
