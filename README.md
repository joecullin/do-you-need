# Code for https://doyouneed.tech/

I love that people buy a whole domain just to put up a one-word joke.

Thought this would be a fun twist. More flexible and more comprehensive, it has answer(s) for every tech you can think of.

Here's an incomplete list of the one-word sites I've seen. Submit a pull request or email me if you want to add more.
